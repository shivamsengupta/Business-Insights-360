This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution tailored to the specific needs of AtliQ Hardware, a leading computer hardware retailer operating across various platforms.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have diligently followed the data analytics lifecycle, gaining proficiency in each phase:

1. **Data Discovery:** I initiated the project by conducting a thorough exploration of available data sources to identify relevant variables and insights.

2. **Data Collection:** This phase involved the meticulous gathering and measurement of pertinent information within the established system. I also explored concepts such as Data Warehousing, OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing).

3. **Data Transformation:** My focus was on converting, cleansing, and structuring data into a format that is not only usable but also optimally supports decision-making processes. I honed my skills in transforming data using Power Query editor and creating Calculated Columns.

4. **Data Modeling:** I meticulously created robust relationships between common columns within multiple tables, expertly modeling data in both Star and Snowflake Schema structures. This included connecting Dimension tables to the Fact table and implementing calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for enhanced analytical capabilities.

5. **Data Visualization:** An essential aspect of this project was building a diverse range of visuals tailored to Atliq Hardware's specific requirements. These visuals are showcased in distinct dashboards, including Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive views.

6. **Data Validation using Excel:** I ensured data accuracy and reliability through meticulous validation procedures using Microsoft Excel.

7. **Implementing Stakeholder Feedback:** Throughout the project, I actively incorporated valuable feedback from stakeholders, ensuring that the final report met their expectations and requirements.
